This project is a React-based landing page for a food app, built by converting a Figma design into a functional layout. Through this project, I've deepened my understanding of the Figma-to-React workflow while advancing my React skills. Future enhancements will include styling updates with Tailwind CSS, as well as optimizations for responsiveness and mobile-friendliness.
